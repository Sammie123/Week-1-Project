    <h1>About Lincoln Nguyen</h1>
    <p>My name is Lincoln Nguyen where I am currently enrolled at Epicodus for web and mobile development. I am 24 and was born and raised in Washington for 24 years. Before I enrolled at Epicodus, I studied at the University of Washington where I graduated with a bachelors in Microbiology. While in college, I studied python, HTML, CSS, and C where I decided to enrolled in a bootcamp that can amplify my skills in web development after I graduated.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is being active in sports such as volleyball, tennis, basketball, and baseball. It does not matter what sport as long as I am active and having fun with my friends. I have an active lifestyle regardless of the weather in Seattle! Teamwork and team-bonding is the fundamental of winning games and the moments that I enjoyed the most. Along with being active, I love to travel and have the dream of traveling around the world with my friends and family.</p>
