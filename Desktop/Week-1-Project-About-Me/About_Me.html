          <p>My name is <strong><span class="lincoln">Lincoln Nguyen</span></strong> where I am currently enrolled at <em>Epicodus</em> for web and mobile development. I am 24 and was born and raised in Washington for 24 years. Before I enrolled at Epicodus, I studied at the <strong>University of Washington</strong> where I graduated with a bachelors in Microbiology. After college, I studied <em>python, HTML, CSS, and C</em> where I decided to enrolled in a bootcamp that can amplify my skills in web development after spending a couple of months on my own learning languages.</p>
          <p>Life before programming was all about healthcare and medical microbiology. My goal was to become a physician assistant (PA) and to continue my education in infectious disease/medical microbiology. Unfortunately, time is not on my side so I decided to try something new. My brother introduced me to the idea of an accelerated bootcamp in web and mobile development. I took interest and spend a couple of months learning a variety of languages, though not an expert, on languages such as python, HTML, CSS, and C. As I continue, I decided to give it a chance as my new career path and choice Epicodus to improve my skills in problem-solving and writing codes.</p>
          <p>One of my favorite hobbies is being <strong>active in sports</strong> such as <em>volleyball, tennis, basketball, and baseball</em>. It does not matter what sport as long as I am active and having fun with my friends. I have an active lifestyle regardless of the weather in Seattle! Teamwork and team-bonding is the fundamental of winning games and the moments that I enjoyed the most. Along with being active, I love to travel and have the dream of traveling around the world with my friends and family.</p>
