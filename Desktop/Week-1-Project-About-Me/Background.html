      <p>Life before programming was all about healthcare and medical microbiology. My goal was to become a physician assistant (PA) and to continue my education in infectious disease/medical microbiology. Unfortunately, time is not on my side so I decided to try something new. My brother introduced me to the idea of an accelerated bootcamp in web and mobile development. I took interest and spend a couple of months learning a variety of languages, though not an expert, on languages such as python, HTML, CSS, and C. As I continue, I decided to give it a chance as my new career path and choice Epicodus to improve my skills in problem-solving and writing codes.</p>
